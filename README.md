# Welcome to my adventure

Hi everyone, 

I am writing this because: I am passionate about technology and I’ve enjoyed understanding the mechanics behind the new innovative solutions and products I’ve encountered in the field of data analytics, machine learning and deep learning. My previous roles inspired me to get closer to the practical side of things and I started studying data science and coding on my own.

## How I keep myself busy

I am currently studying concepts and techniques around:
* Data science: descriptive statistics and predictive analytics.
* Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Algorithms such as: linear models, NLP, tree ensembles (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted decision trees), neural networks.

### What content will you find

I will go through different resources that I use to learn and discuss how helpful they are and what I have learned from it. As books, online classes and schools, data sources, and some troubleshooting. 
Please feel free to drop me a comment or questions at moraite.daniel@gmail.com 

#### Acknowledgements 

This are the people who influenced me the most to pursue this path: first [Marissa Anne S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissasimons/), second [Bogdan Lalu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanlalu/), both of them starting to code from scratch and finally [Laurens Geffert](https://janlauge.github.io). They all have been a moral support and they have also shared valueable resources, insights and mentoring. Big Thank YOU! 


###### Notice
*Since I realized that forking another theme or someone's website template might take me some time (and already took 2 days to make sense of things) I decided to focus first on writing down the data science related posts and continuing studying. For which I would like you all to accept my appologies for a long scrolling up and down.*
