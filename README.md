# Welcome to my adventure
Hi everyone, 

I am writing this because: I am passionate about technology and I’ve enjoyed understanding the mechanics behind the new innovative solutions and products I’ve encountered in the field of data analytics, machine learning and deep learning. 
My previous roles inspired me to get closer to the practical side of things and I started studying data science and coding on my own.
