# Welcome to my adventure
Hi everyone, 

I am writing this because: I am passionate about technology and I’ve enjoyed understanding the mechanics behind the new innovative solutions and products I’ve encountered in the field of data analytics, machine learning and deep learning. My previous roles inspired me to get closer to the practical side of things and I started studying data science and coding on my own.

## How I keep myself busy
I am currently studying concepts and techniques around: 
* Data science: descriptive statistics and predictive analytics.
* Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Algorithms such as: linear models, NLP, tree ensembles (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted decision trees), neural networks.

### What content will you find
I will go through different resources that I use to learn and discuss how helpful they are and what I have learned from it. As books, online classes and schools, data sources, and some troubleshooting. 
Please feel free to drop me a comment or questions at moraite.daniel@gmail.com 

#### Acknowledgements 
This are the people who influenced me the most to pursue this path: first [Marissa Anne S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissasimons/), second [Bogdan Lalu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanlalu/), both of them starting to code from scratch and finally [Laurens Geffert](https://janlauge.github.io). They all have been a moral support and they have also shared valueable resources, insights and mentoring. Big Thank YOU! 


#### Kind Notice
>Since I realized that forking another theme or someone's website template might take me some time (and already took 2 days to make sense of things) I decided to focus first on writing down the data science related posts and continuing studying. For which I would like you all to accept my appologies for a long scrolling up and down.

### Resources 
Learning by doing

Please find bellow a list with all the resources I've been using do far. Feel free to email me if you want to recommend other resources. 
1. [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) Maybe the best classes for beginners, both for python and data science, ML. 
2. [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com) Mostly advanced classes with a few beginners intros to python and data science. Though the classes videos have been taken more than 2 years ago which make it challenging with deprecated libraries. 
3. [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com) is one of latest online schools, that have a pretty good setup and takes you from intro to python, statistics and linear algebra to unsupervised learning, NLP and NN. Pretty effective, with homeworks and slack channel for 24/7 support. 
4. [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) Machine Learning and Deep Learning, maybe not first go to place for beginners though pretty cool videos and examples indeed. 
5. [Python Course](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_for_loop.php) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) are old school lessons - though pretty straight forward and useful.
6. [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs is quite detailed and let you walk from basics to advanced notions.
7. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) I think it is a little bit of hype and a too much marketing around these classes. Personally I haven't found them in particular exceptional. 
And of course the internet is full of resources inlcuding many websites as [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) or if you feel like going one step further into advanced details then feel free to explore the libraries resources [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Book: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller & Sarah Guido - which I find very useful to get the basic and a little bit more. It helped me a lot to understand the mechanics behind many algorythms presented in the online classes above.
