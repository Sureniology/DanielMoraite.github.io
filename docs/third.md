# Pandas 

## Basics 

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) on top of the cute name is one of the basic tools for data science. But first don't forget to install it: `conda install pandas`.

I won't spend much time here to let you know what is good for(read the data, perform analisys, output it neatly and plotting)  and I will just jump into a few data sets examples. 

### Examples: 

* Avocado
You can warm up with this data set. Just had fun with it last weekend when received it from Bogdan: [Introduction - Data Analysis and Data Science with Python and Pandas](https://youtu.be/nLw1RNvfElg)

* Pima
Here you can see a different data set

* etc. 
And the last example

I will return with more examples and feedback (since I am planning to learn more about the full cycle of ... from data cleaning and using it for ML .. to ) ...

#### Tools and Resources: 

Practice makes perfect, and is always better to try your knowledge on data sets that you haven't worked during online classes. A best place to find all sorts of data is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
