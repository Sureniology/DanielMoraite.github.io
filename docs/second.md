# Python 

## Some basics

--------------------------------------------------- 

Since you might already know what python is, or at least will discover later on your own, I will just briefly let you know of the things that I found interesting and useful for a first encounter. 

Terminals are nice to get used with. Since I use a Mac i like to custom my terminal window background with transparent colors.
Make sure you understand how to do basic operations as `cd` changing directories, using python in a terminal, install and uninstall packages and more. 

Definitelly check first if your system contains already a python version `~ Daniel$ python --version` or `~ Daniel$ python3 --version`. So far (March 2019) python 3.6 version is recommended since more stable, compatible with IDEs and easier for beginners to use and not having to spend hours to troubleshoot. If you are confused and clicked on one of those automated python/pip updates for 3.7 version and everything crashes - then no worries - just delete python and reinstall: `~ Daniel$ sudo rm -rf /Applications/Python\ 3.6/` or use any other recommended technique. 
 

### Play first with basics

--------------------------------------------------

I'd say going through some of the available [resources](docs/Resources.md) and play with `if else or while and for loops`, classes and most important don't forget about `arrays` which you deal with when working with pandas and anything else around data science. 

Virtual environments: some would say not to rush into using them if a beginner, though if you are ready to step further into data science and ML, make sure you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) / [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) and then [Jupyter notebook](https://www.jupyter.org). 
I just love when I open my terminal and type `~ Daniel$ conda activate virtenv`and `jupyter notebook`.

Though if bold enough then just pick one of the online classes that shows how to use the above and learn by doing, even if you crash and fail a few times.

#### Tools for Troubleshooting:

Maybe the only one go to place: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=uninstall+python+3.7+on+a+Mac)
Of course you can Google anything as well. 

Good Luck!
