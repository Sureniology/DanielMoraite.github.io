# Welcome to my adventure!
----------------------------

Hi everyone, 

I am writing this since I am passionate about technology and I’ve enjoyed understanding the mechanics behind the new innovative solutions and products I’ve encountered in the field of data analytics, machine learning and deep learning. 

My previous roles inspired me to get closer to the practical side of things and I started studying data science and coding on my own.


## How I keep myself busy:
----------------------------

I am currently studying concepts and techniques around: 
* Data science: descriptive statistics and predictive analytics.
* Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Algorithms such as: linear models, NLP, tree ensembles (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted decision trees), neural networks.


### What content will you find:
----------------------------

I will go through different resources and discuss what is my take from each of them. 
As books, online classes and schools, data sources, and some troubleshooting topics. 



### Acknowledgements: 
----------------------------

The ones who influenced me the most to pursue this path are: first [Marissa Anne S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissasimons/), second [Bogdan Lalu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanlalu/), both of them starting to code from scratch, and finally [Laurens Geffert](https://janlauge.github.io). 

They all have been a moral support and they have also shared valueable resources, insights and mentoring. 
**Big Thank YOU!**
