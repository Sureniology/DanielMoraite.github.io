## How I keep myself busy
I am currently studying concepts and techniques around: 
* Data science: descriptive statistics and predictive analytics.
* Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Algorithms such as: linear models, NLP, tree ensembles (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted decision trees), neural networks.

### What content will you find
I will go through different resources that I use to learn and discuss how helpful they are and what I have learned from it. As books, online classes and schools, data sources, and some troubleshooting. 

#### Acknowledgements 
This are the people who influenced me the most to pursue this path: first [Marissa Anne S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissasimons/), second [Bogdan Lalu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanlalu/), both of them starting to code from scratch and finally [Laurens Geffert](https://janlauge.github.io). They all have been a moral support and they have also shared valueable resources, insights and mentoring. **Big Thank YOU!
