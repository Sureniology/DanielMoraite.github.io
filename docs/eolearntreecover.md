#### Data Extraction

You'll find details of how to get your area of interest AOI coordinates in my previous: [Satellite Imagery Analysis with Python I](https://danielmoraite.github.io/docs/satellite1.html) post.
Make sure you save the coordinates in a file.geojson in the ../eo-learn-master/example_data/.
