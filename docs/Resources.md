### Resources 

##### Motto: Learning by doing!!!
---------------------------------
Please find bellow a list with all the resources I've been using so far. 

1. [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) Maybe the best classes for beginners, both for python and data science, ML. 
2. [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com) Mostly advanced classes with a few beginners intros to python and data science. Though the classes videos have been taken more than 2 years ago which make it challenging with deprecated libraries. 
3. [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com) is one of latest online schools, that have a pretty good setup and takes you from intro to python, statistics and linear algebra to unsupervised learning, NLP and NN. Pretty effective, with homeworks and slack channel for 24/7 support. 
4. [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) Machine Learning and Deep Learning, maybe not first go to place for beginners though pretty cool videos and examples indeed. 
5. [Python Course](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_for_loop.php) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) are old school lessons - though pretty straight forward and useful.
6. [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs is quite detailed and let you walk from basics to advanced notions.
7. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) I think it is a little bit of hype and a too much marketing around these classes. Personally I haven't found them in particular exceptional. 

------------------------------------
And of course the internet is full of resources inlcuding many websites as [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) or if you feel like going one step further into advanced details then feel free to explore the libraries resources [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Book: [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24346909-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-python) by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido - which I find very useful to get the basic and a little bit more. It helped me a lot to understand the mechanics behind many algorythms presented in the online classes above.
